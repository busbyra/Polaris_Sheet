# Polaris_Sheet

This is the start of a character generator for use with Polaris RPG, which is a post-apocalyptic RPG set predominantly under water.  There are several small issues I have currently.  

The biggest happens to be that when I go and try to change values for an attribute, it shows up as false. 

 The other issue I noticed last night is that I need to reorganize the way the class is setup so that it makes more sense.  Likely, I'll make the individual stats into some sort of dictionary within the class.  We'll see!
